# A pong clone made with raylib(-cpp) with an ECS system
This isn't anything serious. Started as a pong clone in pure C with raylib but honestly couldn't live without C++'s OOP features. You might be confused as to why this doesn't really use raylib-cpp that much, I'm still learning the API so it'll be sometime before I fully convert to raylib-cpp.

# This ECS implementation is (bad word)!
Yes, I'm not really basing this off much research, just experimenting around. I'm sure it can be much better, but one has to start from somewhere.
