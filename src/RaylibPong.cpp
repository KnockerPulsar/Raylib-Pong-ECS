  ecs System:
  Instead of creating specific classes from each specific entity, we'd create a basic entity class.
  It would contain mainly a container for all its components (maybe a vector of components pointers perhaps)
  Then we'd create multiple components for the game logic. To add them to an entity, we'd just add them to the vector
  (Or we'd use a function in case we have other internal lists we need to maintain, such as a physics list for example)

// TODO: Drawing all particles to a texture first then displaying that on screen, might be better than lots of drawcalls?

// TODO: 2D layers

// TODO: Implement "ephemeral" and "persistent" scenes

// TODO: Maybe remove system and event checking from the scene code, leaving just the Update() function for custom behaviour?

// TODO: Make adding components to entities at compile time easier (through non-type arguments entt.AddComponents<comp1, comp2,...>())

// TODO: Improve on the "event" system
// Add repeated calls with delay (foo() every 0.5 seconds for example)
// or calls that will be called a certain number of frames/time. (foo() for every frame for 0.5 seconds for example)

// TODO: Instead of remaking the whole quadtree for a mostly static scene, we can mark each collider as "static" or
// "dynamic", then we only need to rebuild the nodes for dynamic colliders

// TODO: Improve on the "scene" system
