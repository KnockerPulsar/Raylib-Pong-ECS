// Description:
/*
    The root is given a list of all colliders in the scene.
    It then goes and creates 4 child rectangles, it then checks if each collider
    is colliding with that child. If so, the collider is added to that child's list.

    If a certain child is colliding with anything, the QuadTree node is created and 
    data is passed to it. (Colliders, its own collision, its parent)

    The parent node should then de-allocate its own collider list since it's not needed

    If a child is not colliding with any object, it's not created 
    If we reached some maximum recursion depth, no more children are created
